# My Application 
## Recipe Finder Application 
I enjoy cooking and wantd to create a streamlined recipe finder site like a Food Network Dupe!

Really want to have the ability to create these sites myself from scratch since all the other platforms charge a premium to host and connect your domain. I enjoy making websites and really want to enhance my skill level.

### Reflection

`What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?` I don't think the planning was terrible since I was just trying to replicate a site I've already done on a platform. I think with more practice the concepts will become easier. 

`Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?` I struggled the most with flexbox properties but I did use flexbox froggy to practice. It will become easier with more practice

`What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?`
