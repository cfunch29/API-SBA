# My Application 
## Recipe Finder Application 
I enjoy cooking and wantd to create a streamlined recipe finder site like a Food Network Dupe!

I used the search meal name to be able to pull up:
---
    - meal id
    - meal name 
    - instructions
    - meal image 
 * This allows me to build an interactive and informative application providing user interaction without unneccesary complexity 

### Technologies Used 
---
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 

### Acknowledgements/Citations
---

### Reflection

`What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?` I am having a difficult time with CSS and making the application visually appealing. I know we were supposed to focus on aesthetics and creativity but for the MVP I just wanted to make sure the code worked and I would build upon that in the future to make it more appealing to the user.  

`Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?` Finding an API is a task in itself. I wanted to make sure it was easy to access and user friendly. I consulted with Dylan because it was giving me a little anxiety looking through all the open source APIs. Some require authorization, they need to have HTTPS, etc. I felt like I needed more time for that but I ultimately found a really good API. 

`What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?` I would add a feature to search meals by ingredients. This would allow the users to find recipes based on ingredients that have available in their kitchen.

I would also add more creativity to the css and display! The design is very streamlined but it could be more appealing!
